Project Name: Nutrify_Tracker
Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
Features:
User Authentication:

Users can register and login, which establishes a personalized session for each user.
Food Search:

Users can search for food items by name. This feature probably utilizes a database or a third-party API to retrieve nutritional information about different food items.
Food Intake Tracking:

After selecting a food item, users can enter the quantity (in grams) theyâ€™ve eaten. This allows the app to track exactly how much of each nutrient they've consumed from that particular food item.
Daily Summary:

The app generates a summary showing all the food items consumed in a day, along with their nutritional values (like calories, protein, carbs, etc.). This summary helps users keep track of their daily intake.
Possible Enhancements
Nutrition Goals: Allow users to set daily goals for calories or other nutrients and show their progress.
Detailed Analytics: Provide weekly or monthly insights on nutrition trends.
API Integration: If not already done, integrate a nutrition API for accurate food data.
